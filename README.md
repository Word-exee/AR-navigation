# AR-navigation
The research investigates the implementation of Augmented Reality (AR) technology for campus
navigation at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIITD), chronicling a
multi-phase journey from initial learning stages to intricate problem-solving over several months.
Initiated with Unity skill acquisition and navigation familiarisation, the project progressed through
prototyping for home-based systems, transitioning to Vuforia following mentor guidance. A pivot to
Google API and Vuforia's area targets facilitated 3D point capture for the 4th floor of RND (Design
Department), albeit with challenges in map quality, rectified through 3D patching and
superimposition techniques.
The team enhanced navigational functionality by incorporating room selection, a mini-map, and
user-centric features, eschewing costly camera systems. Despite persistent debugging, alignment
and angle issues persisted until the functional ARnav (Vuforia) application was developed. This
application enables seamless navigation within the 4th floor of RND at IIITD, representing months
of dedicated efforts, iterative problem-solving, and technical innovations in AR-based campus
navigation. The abstract encapsulates the project's comprehensive evolution, technological
integrations, challenges, and ultimate success in developing a robust AR-based navigation system
tailored for IIITD's Design Department.
